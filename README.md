# Student Data Analysis
## Objective
Maria enlisted our help to analyze student data to get deeper insights into the student results when comparing their grades, their schools, and their type of schools

## Results
We helped Maria put together an analysis that consisted of singling out certain pieces of data and grouping together others to get a deeper sense of how students were performing.
By grouping together types of schools, we were able to see the differences between charter and public schools with how students were grading out. This code and modified versions of it can help Maria and her team develop insights to which schools and school types are the best in the area and to see which grades and subjects the students might need help in.
